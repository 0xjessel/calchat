      | CalChat started when Jesse, Nelson, and Jon signed up for the
      a(href='http://stc.berkeley.edu/competitions.htm#hackathon', target='_blank') Code4Cal Hackathon 
      | back in early 2012. Our goal at the time was just to learn some web dev (NodeJS!), have fun, and maybe build something cool. The idea for CalChat itself stemmed from a desire to help students in the same classes and departments connect better, and to foster a real campus community online by building a product that was tailored to Cal. After placing 3rd at the hackathon, but being dissatisfied with what was decidedly a proof-of-concept MVP, we decided to bring Mark onto the team and enter the 
      a(href='http://stc.berkeley.edu/competitions.htm#webappcomp', target='_blank') STC Web App Competition 
      and bring CalChat closer to what we envisioned. What you see now is still a work in progress, but we hope you like it.
